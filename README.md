## Changelog

### Part 3 Updates (2025-06-19)
- **SEO Optimization:** Added meta title, description, and keywords to all HTML files for better search engine visibility (, `index.html` now includes `<meta name="description" content="Tutoring services for Grade 8-12 in Cape Town">`).
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Added `alt` attributes to all images ( `logo iec.png` now has `alt="Intellectual Enrichment Centre Logo"`) and ARIA roles to navbar (`role="navigation"`).
- **Form Enhancements:** Restructured `contactfile.html` form with HTML5 validation and added JavaScript validation. Created `enquiry.html` with a form for service inquiries.
- **Navbar Fixes:** Added active state CSS and ensured consistent `href` paths (., corrected `contactfile.html` to `contact.html`).
- **Heading Hierarchy:** Fixed multiple `<h1>` tags in `index.html` and `news.html` to use single `<h1>` per page for SEO and accessibility.
- **JavaScript Features:** Added accordion to `services.html`, lightbox gallery to `index.html`, and dynamic content loading to `news.html`.# part3wede
